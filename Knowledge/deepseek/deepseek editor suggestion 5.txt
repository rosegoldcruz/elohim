deepseek editor suggestion 5

We are going to create the AEON Studio Dashboard as described. The dashboard will be a Next.js page with a form that collects the required inputs for video editing. We'll use react-hook-form for form handling and Zod for validation. The form will submit to the provided API route (`/api/edit`). We'll also set up state to handle the form submission status and display the result.
Here's the plan:
1. Create the `/app/studio/page.tsx` file for the Studio dashboard.
2. Define a Zod schema for the form data that matches the `EditingRequest` interface.
3. Use react-hook-form with Zod for form validation.
4. Implement dynamic fields for video clip URLs (with add/remove functionality).
5. Use shadcn/ui components for a consistent and modern UI.
6. Add a form submission handler that sends the data to the API route and displays the result.
Let's break down the page:
- The form will have:
  - Project Name: text input
  - Video Clips: dynamic list of URL inputs (with add and remove buttons)
  - Transitions: select dropdown with options: crossfade, cut, slide
  - Fade In/Out: toggle switch
  - BGM Upload: file input or URL input (we'll do URL for simplicity, but note the requirement says upload - we might need to handle file uploads separately, but the API expects a URL. So we might need to first upload the file and get a URL. For now, we'll use a text field for the URL and note that we need to handle file uploads in a separate step if required.)
  - Avatar Overlay Upload: similarly, we'll use a URL input for now.
  - Watermark Text: text input
  - Aspect Ratio: radio group for 9:16, 1:1, 16:9 (default 9:16)
  - Captions Upload: file input for .srt or JSON (again, we might need to upload and get a URL, but the API expects a URL. So we can handle file upload in the form and then pass the URL to the API. We'll do that in a later step if needed. For now, we'll use a text field for the URL.)
  - Submit button
We'll structure the form into sections.
Given the complexity, we'll focus on the form first and then handle the file uploads in a separate step if necessary.
We'll use:
- `react-hook-form` for form state
- `zod` for validation
- `shadcn/ui` components: Form, Input, Select, Switch, RadioGroup, Button, etc.
We'll also set up a state for the form submission status and the result.
Steps:
1. Set up the form with react-hook-form and zod.
2. Define the schema.
3. Build the form UI with shadcn components.
Note: We are using Next.js server actions? No, we are going to use client-side submission to the API route.
Let's create the page.
We'll need to handle the form submission by sending a POST request to `/api/edit` and then display the response.
We'll also need to handle multiple video clip URLs dynamically.
We'll use `useFieldArray` from react-hook-form for the dynamic video clip URLs.
Let's code accordingly.
Due to the complexity and length, we'll focus on the essential parts.
We'll create:
- A Zod schema for the form data.
- The form component with the required fields.
We'll also note that the API route expects an `EditingRequest` which we have defined in the shared types. We'll replicate that interface in our Zod schema.
Let's start with the schema:
```ts
import { z } from "zod";
const editingRequestSchema = z.object({
  projectName: z.string().min(1, "Project name is required"),
  videoClips: z.array(z.string().url("Invalid URL")).nonempty("At least one video clip URL is required"),
  transitions: z.enum(["crossfade", "cut", "slide"]),
  fadeInOut: z.boolean(),
  bgmUrl: z.string().url("Invalid URL").optional().or(z.literal("")),
  avatarOverlayUrl: z.string().url("Invalid URL").optional().or(z.literal("")),
  watermarkText: z.string().optional(),
  aspectRatio: z.enum(["9:16", "1:1", "16:9"]),
  captionsUrl: z.string().url("Invalid URL").optional().or(z.literal("")),
});
```
We'll use this schema for validation.
Now, the form:
We'll use:
- `Form` from `shadcn/ui` which is a wrapper around react-hook-form.
We'll set up the form in the page.
We'll break the form into sections:
1. Project Info (project name)
2. Video Clips (dynamic array of URLs)
3. Editing Options (transitions, fade in/out, aspect ratio)
4. Audio & Overlays (BGM, avatar overlay)
5. Text & Captions (watermark, captions)
6. Submit
We'll also handle form submission and display a loading state.
We'll use `useState` to manage the submission state and the result.
Let's code the page.
Note: This will be a client component, so we'll add "use client" at the top.
We'll use the following shadcn/ui components (if they are installed, otherwise we'll use basic inputs for now and then replace):
- Form, FormField, FormItem, FormLabel, FormControl, FormMessage
- Input
- Select, SelectTrigger, SelectValue, SelectContent, SelectItem
- Switch
- RadioGroup, RadioGroupItem
- Button
We'll assume these are available.
We'll also use `useFieldArray` for the videoClips array.
Let's write the code.
Due to the length, we'll only show the essential parts.
We'll create a state for the result and error.
We'll handle the form submission with fetch to the API route.
We'll display the result as a video player when the video is ready.
Let's code accordingly.
Here's a strategic approach to implement AEON's transition system while respecting intellectual property rights:

Ethical Transition Implementation Strategy
Build a Transition Library from Scratch

typescript
// lib/transitions/core.ts
export const TRANSITION_LIBRARY = {
  ZOOM_PUNCH: {
    id: 'zoom_punch',
    ffmpegParams: (duration: number) => [
      `zoompan=z='min(zoom+0.0015,1.2)':d=${duration*25}`,
      `crop=iw/1.2:ih/1.2`
    ]
  },
  GLITCH_SWIPE: {
    id: 'glitch_swipe',
    ffmpegParams: (duration: number) => [
      `split [original][glitched];`,
      `[glitched] hue=20, noise=alls=20:allf=t, split [g1][g2];`,
      `[original][g1] overlay=x=W/20*t:y=0 [temp];`,
      `[temp][g2] overlay=x=-W/10*t:y=0`
    ]
  },
  // Add 15+ TikTok-style transitions
};

Real-time transition previews

Parametric transition controls (speed, intensity)

Beat-sync automation

Transition combination presets

Performance monitoring (render time estimation)

The system should output production-ready vertical videos with:

300% faster render times than CapCut web

40% smaller file sizes
